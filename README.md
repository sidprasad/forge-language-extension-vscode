VS Code support for [Forge](https://forge-fm.org/).

## Highlights

- Run Forge files with robust process management (Racket discovery, version checks, graceful stop).
- LSP essentials: go to definition, hover, and document symbols.
- Syntax highlighting and language configuration for `.frg`.

## Quick start

1. Install Racket and Forge: `raco pkg install forge`
2. Install the extension from the 
3. Open a `.frg` file and run `Forge: Run` (or click the Run button).

## UI/UX reliability

- Consistent run/stop/continue flows with clear output channels.
- Diagnostics parsed into VS Code Problems with clickable links.
- No shell wrappers for execution, which keeps behavior predictable and safer.
- Friendly errors when Racket or Forge are missing or out of date.

## Commands

- `Forge: Run`
- `Forge: Stop`
- `Forge: Continue Forge Run`
- `Forge: Enable Logging`
- `Forge: Disable Logging`
- `Forge: Forge Docs`

## Settings

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `forge.racketPath` | string | `""` | Path to Racket executable. Leave empty to auto-detect. |
| `forge.minVersion` | string | `"3.3.0"` | Minimum Forge version required. |
| `forgeLanguageServer.maxNumberOfProblems` | number | `100` | Max diagnostics produced by the server. |
| `forgeLanguageServer.trace.server` | string | `"messages"` | LSP trace verbosity. |

## Testing

- `npm test` runs the VS Code extension test harness via `scripts/e2e.sh`.
- `npm run lint` checks client/server linting.
- Manual QA focus: run/stop/continue, missing Racket, old Forge versions, diagnostics, and LSP navigation.
